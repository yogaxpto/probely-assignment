# Technical Assignment

We decided to build a mobile application for our customers, so that they can order our products using their phones. Your
goal is to build the backend for this application.

### Requirements

* Customers may exchange their username and password for an authentication token
* Customers may see a paginated list of products. Each product in the list should have the following details: `id`
  , `name`, `price`, and `quantity in stock`
* Customers may order the products they need
* Number of products in stock should decrease after an order is made
* Customers may see their history of orders.

### Technical details

* Django 4.x (any modules, any data structures)
* API only, no need for UI
* Please host your repository on Github and either make it public or provide access to `martinOpply` for review.

### Concluding remarks

* We expect that the assignment takes around 3-4 hours. Do as much as you can within this timeframe and provide a
  description of what else you'd like to do but were unable to due to limited time.
* Despite this being an exercise, we would appreciate it if you approach it with a production-mindset, i.e. feel free to
  include anything that you consider relevant for scaling or easy maintainability

### Bonus points

* Provide deployment instructions for one of the major providers (GCP, AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc). No need for actual
  configuration scripts: 2-3 sentences is enough.
